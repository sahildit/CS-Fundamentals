## Data Structures
Data structure is a particluar way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.


## Array
Array is a collection if items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value.

## Binary Tree
A tree whole elements have at most 2 children is called a B-tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.

## Graph
A graph is a non-linear data structure considering of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

## Linked List
A Linked List is a linear data structure, where a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

## Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree also called sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the nodes's left subtree and less than those in the right subtree. [hint - left nodes will have all small number than the root and right nodes will have higher numbers]

## Matrix
A Matrix represents a collection of numbers arranged in an order of rows and columns. It is necessary to enclose the elements of a matrix in parentheses or brackets.

## Stack
A stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed with 2 main operations: Push, which adds an element to the collection. and : Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
