## Data Structures
Data structure is a particluar way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.


## Array
Array is a collection if items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value.

## Binary Tree
A tree whole elements have at most 2 children is called a B-tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.

## Graph
A graph is a non-linear data structure considering of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

## Linked List
A Linked List is a linear data structure, where a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

## Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree also called sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the nodes's left subtree and less than those in the right subtree. [hint - left nodes will have all small number than the root and right nodes will have higher numbers]

## Matrix
A Matrix represents a collection of numbers arranged in an order of rows and columns. It is necessary to enclose the elements of a matrix in parentheses or brackets.

## Stack
A stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed with 2 main operations: Push, which adds an element to the collection. and : Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

## Heap
A heap is a special tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Genarally heap can be two types:
 1 - Max-heap: In an max heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among all keys present at all of its children.
 2 - Min-heap: In a min heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among all keys present at all of its children.

## Queue
A queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. Its FIFO(first in first out). A good example of queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that come first is served first.

## Difference betwenn stack and queue  is in removing

## Hashing
Hashing is an important datastructure which is designed to use a special function called the hash function which is used to map a given value with a particular key for faster access of elements. The effiency of mapping depends of the effiency of the hash function used.
