## Data Structures
Data structure is a particluar way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.


## Array
Array is a collection if items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value.

## Binary Tree
A tree whole elements have at most 2 children is called a B-tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.

## Graph
A graph is a non-linear data structure considering of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.
